# Steps

## 1. Define the Features

Start by listing what your To-Do List should do. Consider including:

- **Add Tasks:**  
  Allow users to enter a new task via an input field and add it to the list.

- **Display Tasks:**  
  Show the list of tasks in a clear, organized format (e.g., as list items).

- **Mark as Completed:**  
  Enable users to mark a task as done (e.g., via a checkbox or button). Completed tasks could be visually distinguished (strikethrough, color change).

- **Delete Tasks:**  
  Provide a way to remove tasks from the list.

- **Edit Tasks (Optional):**  
  Allow users to modify the text of an existing task.

- **Filter Tasks:**  
  Include options to filter the list—show all tasks, only active tasks, or only completed tasks.

- **Persist Data:**  
  Store tasks so that they remain even if the user refreshes the browser. This can be achieved by using browser local storage or an external API if you decide to add a backend later.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Ensure the interface is usable on different devices, including mobile.

- **Optional Enhancements:**
  - **Task Reordering:** Implement drag-and-drop to reorder tasks.
  - **Categories or Tags:** Let users assign categories to tasks for better organization.
  - **Due Dates/Reminders:** Allow users to set deadlines and reminders.
  - **Animations/Transitions:** Add subtle animations for a smoother user experience.

## 2. Plan the Project Structure

### a. Application Architecture

- **State Management:**  
  Consider using an array to represent your tasks, where each task is an object with properties like:

  - _id:_ A unique identifier.
  - _text:_ The content of the task.
  - _completed:_ A boolean to indicate if the task is done.

- **Component Structure (for a component-based framework like React):**
  - **App Component:**  
    The main container that holds all other components.
  - **Header/Input Component:**  
    A section where users can type in new tasks.
  - **Task List Component:**  
    Displays all the tasks. It can be broken down further:
    - **Task Item Component:**  
      Each task, showing text, a complete toggle, and delete/edit options.
  - **Filter/Control Component:**  
    Contains buttons or links for filtering tasks (all, active, completed).

### b. Data Flow

- **Input Handling:**  
  Capture user input and update the state accordingly.
- **Task Management:**  
  When adding, editing, or deleting tasks, update the state to reflect these changes.
- **UI Updates:**  
  Re-render the list based on the current state (e.g., which tasks are completed).

## 3. Steps to Build the Application

### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

- **Choose Your Stack:**  
  Decide on your primary technology (e.g., React for a web app).
- **Initialize the Project:**  
  Use your development tools (like create-react-app for React) to set up the project structure.
- **Organize Folders:**  
  Create folders for components, styles, and assets.

### Step 2: Build the User Interface

- **Design the Layout:**  
  Sketch the UI (paper or digital wireframe) focusing on a minimalistic design similar to Pinterest’s clean style.
- **Develop Components:**
  - **Header/Input Component:**  
    Create an area where users can type a task and submit it.
  - **Task List & Task Item Components:**  
    Build a component that displays the list of tasks. Each task should show its text and controls for marking complete, editing, or deleting.
  - **Filter/Control Component:**  
    Add buttons or links to filter the tasks (all, active, completed).

### Step 3: Implement Core Functionality

- **Adding a Task:**  
  Connect the input field to a function that creates a new task object and adds it to your state.
- **Displaying Tasks:**  
  Loop through your state array to display each task using your Task Item component.
- **Marking Tasks as Completed:**  
  Add a mechanism (like a checkbox or button) that toggles the task’s completed status and updates the UI accordingly.
- **Deleting Tasks:**  
  Implement a delete option that removes the task from the state and updates the view.
- **Editing Tasks (Optional):**  
  Allow the task text to be editable when needed, then update the state with the new text.

### Step 4: Implement Filtering and Sorting

- **Filter Logic:**  
  Write logic to display only active tasks or only completed tasks based on the user’s selection.
- **UI Feedback:**  
  Visually indicate which filter is active.

### Step 5: Persisting Data

- **Local Storage:**  
  Use local storage to save the state of tasks. On application load, check for saved tasks and load them into the state.
- **Data Updates:**  
  Update local storage each time the task list is modified (adding, editing, deleting, marking complete).

### Step 6: Testing and Debugging

- **Manual Testing:**  
  Interact with your app to ensure each feature works as expected.
- **Edge Cases:**  
  Test how the app handles empty inputs, duplicate tasks, or rapid updates.
- **Bug Fixes:**  
  Identify and fix any issues that arise.

### Step 7: Enhancements and Optional Features

- **UI/UX Improvements:**  
  Polish the design with animations or better error handling (e.g., showing an error message if a task is empty).
- **Extra Features:**  
  Consider adding features like task reordering (via drag-and-drop), due dates, or categories once the basic functionality is stable.

### Step 8: Deployment

- **Prepare for Deployment:**  
  Once your app is working as expected, prepare it for deployment.
- **Hosting:**  
  Use free or low-cost hosting solutions (like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel) to share your project.

### Step 9: Reflect and Iterate

- **User Feedback:**  
  If possible, share the app with friends or peers to get feedback.
- **Iterate:**  
  Use the feedback to make small improvements or add features that enhance the user experience.
